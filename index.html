The null hypothesis is $H_0: \\beta_{age} \\ne 0$, meaning customer age has a significant effect on churn.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "`statsmodels` is the correct library choice for this task. However, this statement describes the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$), which is what you are trying to find evidence for, not the default assumption of no effect." },

The null hypothesis is that the p-value for 'customer_age' is less than 0.05.", "isCorrect": false, "rationale": "While `scikit-learn` is a comprehensive library, it intentionally does not provide p-values for regression coefficients.

The business must weigh the tiny conversion lift against the cost of deployment.", "isCorrect": true, "rationale": "This correctly separates the statistical verdict (the effect is real) from the practical one (the effect is tiny). The decision to implement depends on whether this small gain is worth the cost, a key business consideration." },
